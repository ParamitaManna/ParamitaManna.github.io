## About me
* I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [Prof. Jacob Klein's lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/MCMS/klein/) at the Molecular Chemistry & Materials Science Department of Weizmann Institute of Science.

## Education
* B.Sc. in Chemistry (Hons.) with Physics and Mathematics, [Jadavpur University](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/), Kolkata, India
* M.Sc. in Analytical Chemistry, [Jadavpur University](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/), Kolkata, India
* Ph.D. in the Department of Desalination and Water Treatment, [Ben-Gurion University of the Negev](https://www.bgu.ac.il/en/), Israel
  - __Thesis title__: Stepwise fabrication of polymeric barrier films of membranes for rational design of morphology and separation properties

## Research Experience
- __Postdoctoral Research Fellow__, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.
  - Understanding the molecular basis of lubrication of stealth liposomes using Surface Force Balance (SFB).
   - Investigating peptide–lipid membrane interactions to understand the affinity of peptide-conjugated liposomes towards collagen-coated surfaces and the effect of the presence of the peptide on the lubrication behavior of the liposomes.
   - Studying the phase separation behavior of mixed lipid systems using AFM, cryo-TEM, and fluorescence imaging.
  
- __Ph.D. Thesis__, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sde Boker, Israel.
  - Stepwise synthesis of ultrathin oligomeric barrier films on porous polymer membranes to control their properties and performances, investigating the effect of the number of synthesis cycles, and the impact of different support membranes.
  - Synthesis of polymer membranes with a cross-linked network for organic solvent nanofiltration.
  - Fabrication of zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF) based thin-film composite (TFC) membranes for water purification.
- __Project-Junior Research Fellow__, CSIR-CSMCRI, Gujarat, India.
  - Modification of thin-film composite (TFC) polymeric membranes for the removal of hazardous pesticides from water.
- __Master Dissertation__, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India.
  -  __Dissertation title__: Investigation of the kinetics of oxidation of L-cysteine by a μ–oxo diiron (III, III) complex in aqueous acidic media
